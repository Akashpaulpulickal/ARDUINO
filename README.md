# ARDUINO
**Arduino** is an open-source electronics platform with easy-to-use hardware and software. It reads inputs like sensor data and produces outputs like activating LEDs. **Arduino programming** uses simplified C++ in the IDE, focusing on `setup()` for initial settings and `loop()` for continuous tasks.
