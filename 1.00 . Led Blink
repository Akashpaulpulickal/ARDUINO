// Code to blink an LED

void setup() {
  // Initialize digital pin 13 as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  // Wait for a second
  delay(1000);
  // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  // Wait for a second
  delay(1000);
}








Connecting the LED:
LED Anode (longer leg): Connect this to digital pin 13 on the Arduino board.

LED Cathode (shorter leg): Connect this to a 220-ohm resistor.

Resistor: Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND (ground) pin on the Arduino.
